# Visa Prediction Project with MLOps Implementation

Welcome to the Visa Prediction Project! This project combines the power of Data Science with MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) to automate the process of visa application approval or rejection prediction. By leveraging MLOps practices, we ensure efficient model development, deployment, and monitoring, resulting in a robust and scalable solution.

## Overview

The Visa Prediction Project employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict the approval or rejection of visa applications. This project is not just about building models; it's about implementing end-to-end MLOps pipelines to streamline the entire lifecycle of model development, deployment, and maintenance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components, each serving a specific MLOps purpose:

- **Setup**: Scripts and instructions for setting up the project environment, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring MongoDB Atlas for data storage.

- **Data Ingestion**: Components for fetching, loading, and storing visa application data from external sources (such as Kaggle) into MongoDB Atlas for further processing.

- **EDA and Feature Engineering**: Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and prepare the data for modeling.

- **Data Validation**: Components for validating the integrity and quality of the data to ensure that only clean and reliable data is used for training the models.

- **Data Transformation**: Scripts and components for transforming the raw data into a format suitable for model training, including preprocessing and normalization steps.

- **Model Training**: Components for training machine learning models on the processed data, including hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation.

- **Model Evaluation**: Components for evaluating the performance of trained models using various metrics and selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

- **Model Deployment**: Scripts, Dockerfiles, and instructions for deploying the selected model as a scalable and reliable service, including setting up AWS services for hosting the model.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configuration files and workflows for implementing a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of models with every code change.

## MLOps Implementation Highlights

This project showcases best practices in MLOps implementation, including:

- **Dockerization**: Containerizing the model training and deployment processes using Docker to ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate testing, building Docker images, and deploying models to production environments.

- **Model Pusher**: Implementing a model pusher component to automatically push trained models to an AWS S3 bucket for versioning and storage.

- **AWS Integration**: Leveraging AWS services such as EC2, S3, and ECR for model hosting, storage, and infrastructure management, ensuring scalability and reliability of the deployed solution.

## Usage

To get started with the project and experience the power of MLOps in action, follow these steps:

1. Set up your project environment by creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas and create a new project for storing the project data.

3. Fetch the visa application data from the provided Kaggle link and push it to MongoDB Atlas using the provided scripts.

4. Explore the data using the EDA notebooks and perform feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

5. Train machine learning models using the provided scripts and components, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

6. Deploy the best-performing model for real-time predictions using Docker and AWS services.
