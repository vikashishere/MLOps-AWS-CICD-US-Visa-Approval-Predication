1. Create project template by executing template.py file
2. Write the code on setup.py file to import local packages
3. Create a virtual env, activate it and install the requirements from requirements.txt
   conda create -n visa python=3.8 -y
   conda activate visa
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Do a "pip list" on terminal to make sure you have local packages installed
5. Sign up to MongoDB Atlas and create a new project by just providing it a name then next next create.
6. From "Create a deployment" screen, hit "create", Select M0 service keeping other services as default, hit "create deployment"
7. Setup the username and password and then create user.
8. Go to "network access" and add ip address - "0.0.0.0/0" so that we can access it from anywhere
9. "Connect" >> "Drivers" >> {Driver:Python, Version:3.6 or later} >> copy and save the connection string 
   with you(replace password). >> Done.
10. Create folder "notebook" >> create file "mongoDB_demo.ipynb" >> select kernal>python kernal>visa >>
11. Kaggle Data link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset
12. Push your data to mongoDB database from your python notebook.
13. Go to mongoDB Atlas >> Database >> browse collection >> see your data in key value format
14. Write the logger file and test it on demo.py
15. Write the exception file and test it on demo.py
16. EDA and Feature Engg notebook added.
17. Before we work on "Data Ingestion" component >> Declare variables within constants.__init__.py file >> 
    setup a configuration.mongo_db_connections.py file and define the func for mondodb connection >> 
    Now create a new dir "data_access", then a new file inside named usvisa_data that will use mongo_db_connections.py
    to connect with DB, fetch data in key-val format and transform that to df >>
    add code to entity.config_entity.py file till DataIngestionConfig class >>
    add code to entity.artifact_entity.py file till DataIngestionArtifact class >>
    add code to components.data_ingestion.py file >> run demo.py (set mongodb connection url first, see next step)
18. To setup the connection url on mac(also work for windows), open bash terminal and run below command:
    export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>...."
    To setup the connection url on Windos, open env variable setting option and add a new variable:
    Name: MONGODB_URL, Value = <url>
19. Complete the work on config.schema.yaml file (add entire info about dataset for data validation step)
20. Now work on the "Data Validation" component the way we did in step 17 for Data Ingestion. (Workflow mentioned below)
